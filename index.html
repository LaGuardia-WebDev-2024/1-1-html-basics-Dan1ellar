<h1> Don't Smile Lyrics</h1>

  <p> Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over <br>
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her <br>
<br>
My heart is heavy now, it's like a hundred pounds <br>
It's falling faster than the way you love to shut me down <br>
I think I need a shower, my friends are taking shots <br>
You think it's happy hour, for me it's not <br>
<br>
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over <br>
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her <br>
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over <br>
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me <br>
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her <br>
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me <br>
<br>
Pour my feelings in the microphone <br>
I stay in, and when the girls come home <br>
I want one of them to take my phone <br>
Take my phone and lose your <br>
Number, I don't wanna be tempted <br>
Pick up when you wanna fall back in <br>
You can fake it, but you know I know <br>
Know I know <br>
<br>
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over <br>
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her <br>
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over <br>
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me <br>
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her <br>
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me <br> </p>
